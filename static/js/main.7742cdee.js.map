This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

The next couple of capturing groups give information \n\t *    about the Twitter handle match.\n\t * 2. The whitespace character before the \\@sign in a Twitter handle. This is needed because there are no lookbehinds in\n\t *    JS regular expressions, and can be used to reconstruct the original string in a replace().\n\t * 3. The Twitter handle itself in a Twitter match. If the match is '@someTwitterUser', the handle is 'someTwitterUser'.\n\t * 4. Group that matches an email address. Used to determine if the match is an email address, as well as holding the full \n\t *    address. Ex: 'me@my.com'\n\t * 5. Group that matches a URL in the input text. Ex: 'http://google.com', 'www.google.com', or just 'google.com'.\n\t *    This also includes a path, url parameters, or hash anchors. Ex: google.com/path/to/file?q1=1&q2=2#myAnchor\n\t * 6. Group that matches a protocol URL (i.e. 'http://google.com'). This is used to match protocol URLs with just a single\n\t *    word, like 'http://localhost', where we won't double check that the domain name has at least one '.' in it.\n\t * 7. A protocol-relative ('//') match for the case of a 'www.' prefixed URL. Will be an empty string if it is not a \n\t *    protocol-relative match. We need to know the character before the '//' in order to determine if it is a valid match\n\t *    or the // was in a string we don't want to auto-link.\n\t * 8. A protocol-relative ('//') match for the case of a known TLD prefixed URL. Will be an empty string if it is not a \n\t *    protocol-relative match. See #6 for more info. \n\t */\n\tmatcherRegex : (function() {\n\t\tvar twitterRegex = /(^|[^\\w])@(\\w{1,15})/,              // For matching a twitter handle.
